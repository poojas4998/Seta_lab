# Seta_lab

During the summer of 2023 I started a summer internship at Seta Lab in the Vascular Biology section in the Boston University Medical Campus section. Here, I processed , analyzed and biologically interpreted Bulk RNA sequencing datasets using snakemake framekwork in python, differential expression analysis and gene set enrichment analysis.
